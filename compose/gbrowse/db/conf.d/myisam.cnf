# Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.
# Do not set it larger than 30% of your available memory, as some memory
# is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if you're not using
# MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 8-64M as it will also be
# used for internal temporary disk tables.
key_buffer_size		= 128M

# This value controls the demotion of buffers from the hot sublist of a key cache
# to the warm sublist. Lower values cause demotion to happen more quickly.
# The minimum value is 100. The default value is 300. See Section 8.10.2,
# “The MyISAM Key Cache”, Midpoint insertion strategy in particoular
#key_cache_age_threshold = 300

# The size in bytes of blocks in the key cache. The default value is 1024. See
# Section 8.10.2, “The MyISAM Key Cache”.
#key_cache_block_size = 1024

# By default, the key cache management system uses a simple LRU strategy for choosing key
# cache blocks to be evicted, but it also supports a more sophisticated method called
# the midpoint insertion strategy. When using the midpoint insertion strategy, the LRU chain
# is divided into two parts: a hot sublist and a warm sublist. The division point between two
# parts is not fixed, but the key cache management system takes care that the warm part
# is not “too short,” always containing at least key_cache_division_limit percent of the key
# cache blocks. key_cache_division_limit is a component of structured key cache variables,
# so its value is a parameter that can be set per cache. When an index block is read from a
# table into the key cache, it is placed at the end of the warm sublist. After a certain
# number of hits (accesses of the block), it is promoted to the hot sublist. At present, the
# number of hits required to promote a block (3) is the same for all index blocks. A block
# promoted into the hot sublist is placed at the end of the list. The block then circulates
# within this sublist. If the block stays at the beginning of the sublist for a long enough time,
# it is demoted to the warm sublist. This time is determined by the value of the
# key_cache_age_threshold component of the key cache. The midpoint insertion strategy
# enables you to keep more-valued blocks always in the cache. If you prefer to use the plain
# LRU strategy, leave the key_cache_division_limit value set to its default of 100.

# The division point between the hot and warm sublists of the key cache buffer
# list. The value is the percentage of the buffer list to use for the warm sublist.
# Permissible values range from 1 to 100. The default value is 100. See Section
# 8.10.2, “The MyISAM Key Cache”.
key_cache_division_limit = 90

# Size of the buffer used for doing full table scans of MyISAM tables.
# Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed.
read_buffer_size = 2M

# When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read
# through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. You can improve ORDER BY
# performance a lot, if set this to a high value.
# Allocated per thread, when needed.
read_rnd_buffer_size = 4M

# MyISAM uses special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts (that is,
# INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ..., and LOAD DATA
# INFILE) faster. This variable limits the size of the cache tree in
# bytes per thread. Setting it to 0 will disable this optimisation.  Do
# not set it larger than "key_buffer_size" for optimal performance.
# This buffer is allocated when a bulk insert is detected.
bulk_insert_buffer_size = 32M

# This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in
# REPAIR, OPTIMIZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE
# into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with
# large settings.
myisam_sort_buffer_size = 32M

# The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while
# recreating the index (during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA INFILE.
# If the file-size would be bigger than this, the index will be created
# through the key cache (which is slower).
myisam_max_sort_file_size = 5G

# If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger
# than using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the
# key cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in
# large tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.

# If a table has more than one index, MyISAM can use more than one
# thread to repair them by sorting in parallel. This makes sense if you
# have multiple CPUs and plenty of memory.
myisam_repair_threads = 1

# Automatically check and repair not properly closed MyISAM tables.
# Set the MyISAM storage engine recovery mode. The option value is any
# combination of the values of OFF, DEFAULT, BACKUP, FORCE, or QUICK.
# If you specify multiple values, separate them by commas. Specifying the
# option with no argument is the same as specifying DEFAULT, and specifying
# with an explicit value of "" disables recovery (same as a value of OFF). If recovery
# is enabled, each time mysqld opens a MyISAM table, it checks whether the
# table is marked as crashed or was not closed properly. (The last option works
# only if you are running with external locking disabled.) If this is the case,
# mysqld runs a check on the table. If the table was corrupted, mysqld attempts
# to repair it.
